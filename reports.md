# Audio API Implementation Reports

## 2025-07-01: AudioContext Pattern Implementation

### Changes Made
1. **Created AudioContext class** - Replacing AudioGraphBuilder with a GraphicsContext2D-like pattern
   - Provides fluent API for building audio graphs
   - Methods like CreateSourceNode, CreateGainNode, ConnectTo, etc.
   - Automatic output node detection and graph building

2. **Updated Composer class**
   - Added support for holding AudioNodes directly
   - Modified ComposeCore to accept AudioContext instead of Audio
   - Compose method now creates AudioContext and delegates to ComposeCore
   - ComposeWithContext handles graph building from context

3. **Added Sound.Compose method**
   - Allows Sound objects to build their nodes in an AudioContext
   - Returns the final AudioNode for further composition

4. **Updated SceneComposer**
   - Now uses AudioContext in ComposeCore
   - Builds audio graph using Sound.Compose method
   - Automatically creates mixer for multiple sounds

### Architecture Benefits
- More intuitive API similar to GraphicsContext2D
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to compose complex audio graphs
- Maintains backward compatibility while improving architecture
